# Stepcast automation & intents

Stepcast's external surface for Tasker, Bixby Routines, MacroDroid, adb,
and anything else that can send an Android broadcast or intent.

## Broadcast commands

Send an **explicit broadcast** to the command receiver:

- **Package:** `com.nsavage.stepcast`
- **Receiver:** `com.nsavage.stepcast.playback.CommandReceiver` (exported)
- **Action prefix:** `com.nsavage.stepcast.command.`

| Action | Effect | Extras |
|---|---|---|
| `…command.PLAY` | Start/resume playback | — |
| `…command.PAUSE` | Pause | — |
| `…command.TOGGLE` | Play if paused, pause if playing | — |
| `…command.NEXT` | Skip to the next queue item | — |
| `…command.PREVIOUS` | Back to the previous item | — |
| `…command.SEEK_BACK` | Seek back (configured increment) | — |
| `…command.SEEK_FORWARD` | Seek forward (configured increment) | — |
| `…command.DONE` | Mark played + delete download + advance | — |
| `…command.REFRESH` | Refresh all feeds now (silent) | — |
| `…command.REFRESH_CATEGORY` | Refresh one category's feeds now | `category` (string): the category name, case-insensitive. `name` also accepted. |
| `…command.START_SMART_PLAY` | Fill the queue from a SmartPlay's rules and start playing. If the SmartPlay is marked as a Station, it becomes the active station and keeps refilling the queue. | `smartplay` (string): the SmartPlay's name, case-insensitive. `name` also accepted. |

### adb examples

```sh
adb shell am broadcast -a com.nsavage.stepcast.command.TOGGLE \
    -n com.nsavage.stepcast/.playback.CommandReceiver

adb shell am broadcast -a com.nsavage.stepcast.command.START_SMART_PLAY \
    -n com.nsavage.stepcast/.playback.CommandReceiver \
    --es smartplay "News"

adb shell am broadcast -a com.nsavage.stepcast.command.REFRESH_CATEGORY \
    -n com.nsavage.stepcast/.playback.CommandReceiver \
    --es category "News"
```

### Tasker / Bixby Routines

Use a "Send Intent / Broadcast" action with:

- Action: `com.nsavage.stepcast.command.START_SMART_PLAY`
- Package: `com.nsavage.stepcast`
- Class: `com.nsavage.stepcast.playback.CommandReceiver`
- Target: Broadcast Receiver
- Extra: `smartplay: News` (only for START_SMART_PLAY)

Setting the package/class (an explicit broadcast) is required on modern
Android — implicit broadcasts to manifest receivers are not delivered.

## Feed URL intents

`MainActivity` accepts podcast links from other apps; each lands in
Discover with the URL prefilled:

- **Share (ACTION_SEND, text/plain):** share any text containing an
  http(s) feed URL to Stepcast — the first URL in the text is used.
- **Classic podcast schemes (ACTION_VIEW):** `pcast://…`, `podcast://…`,
  `itpc://…`, `feed://…` (all normalized to https), plus `pcast:` and
  `feed:` prefixed URLs.

## Home-screen surfaces

Not intents you send, but automation-adjacent:

- **SmartPlays widget** — lists your SmartPlays; one tap fills the queue
  and starts playback without opening the app.
- **Launcher shortcuts** — long-press the app icon for the first four
  SmartPlays. (Internally these route
  `com.nsavage.stepcast.shortcut.SMARTPLAY` through MainActivity — an
  implementation detail, not a stable external API; automate via the
  broadcast above instead.)
- **Player / bar / mini / play-button widgets** — transport controls
  backed by the same command handling as the media notification.
